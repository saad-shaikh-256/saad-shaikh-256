# Hey there! I'm Saad 👋

#### Front-end Developer | UI/UX Designer | Final Year MCA Student

## About Me
I'm a front-end developer who focuses on building **responsive**, **clean**, and **user-friendly interfaces**. I’ve been designing UI for over **1+ years** and now specialize in bringing those designs to life with code.

Currently pursuing my MCA (graduating in 2026), I spend most of my time working with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React** - along with **Figma** for design.

> Designing experiences that connect people with technology - guided by a curious mind, a developer’s heart, and a designer’s eye.

- 🧑‍💻 Working with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and exploring modern web tech
- 🎨 Designing UI/UX in **Figma** — wireframes, mockups, and interactive prototypes
- 🧠 Building real-world projects to grow my front-end skills
- 💡 Always experimenting with new design ideas to make the web feel natural and intuitive
